# Screenshots and Visual References

The `assets/images/` directory contains placeholder images. Replace these with screenshots captured from the running application.

Placeholders included:

- `assets/images/ui-light.png` — Main UI (light)
- `assets/images/ui-dark.png` — Main UI (dark)
- `assets/images/api-endpoints.svg` — API endpoints overview

How to take screenshots

1. Start the system: `docker-compose up -d --build`
2. Open the UI at `http://localhost:8000/ui` (or http://localhost:8501 if you prefer Streamlit)
3. Capture the full browser window (Windows: Win+Shift+S) and save as PNG into `assets/images/`, replacing placeholders.
4. Commit the images and push.

Suggested screenshot list:

- UI Light theme — full page
- UI Dark theme — full page
- API Endpoints — query/response or Postman screenshot
